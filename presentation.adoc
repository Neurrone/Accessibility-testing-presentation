* Testing  website works with assistive technology

Though I say website since most of you are doing web development, it generalizes to e.g desktop and mobile applications as well.

## Why Do Accessibility Testing?

* Ensures your website is accessible - can be used by as many people as possible
* Overlaps with other best practices e.g mobile web design, usability

Especially important for government services due to aging population.

## What is a screen reader?

* Software that enables the blind to use computers independently
* Provides additional keyboard commands for efficient navigation and information retrieval
* Demo
* Examples:
** link:https://www.nvaccess.org/[NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)] for Windows
** link:https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/[VoiceOver], built into  Mac and iOS
** link:https://support.google.com/talkback/[TalkBack], built into Android

## How do screen readers work?

* Relies on applications providing info on  state of their UIs
** For websites, that means using **semantics of html elements**

image:dom.gif[The DOM for a simple document. The root html node has 2 children: head and body. Head has a <title>my title</title> as its child. The body node has 2 children: <a href="...">my link</a> and <h1>my heading</h1>]

## How to make websites accessible?

* link:https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php[WCAG 2.0 standard] is used to formally  evaluate accessibility
* Use link:http://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/[**semantic HTML**]:
** Use `<h1>, ..., <h6>` for headers, styling them with CSS
** Use  `<table>` for tables
** Associate `<label>` with form controls with the `for` attribute

* link:http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/[Include `alt` attribute in images]
* link:http://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/[Make all functionality available through the keyboard]
** Use `tabindex=0` to include element in tab navigation
* Use native HTML5 controls when possible, and link:https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria[ARIA] on custom UI widgets
* link:http://accessibility.psu.edu/color/contrasthtml/[Provide sufficient color contrast], and don't use color alone to convey info
* Use responsive design to optimize layout for various screen sizes

## How to do accessibility testing?

* Automated vs manual testing
* Numerous automated linting tools like link:https://github.com/accesslint/accesslint.js[accesslint.js] can find issues such as:
** Missing alt attribute in images
** Insufficient color contrast
** Duplicate IDs

## Manual Testing

* During development:
** Browser add-ons like link:http://wave.webaim.org/extension/[WAVE]
** link:https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1169/pages/tab-key-navigation-test[Tab key navigation test] and link:https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1169/pages/select-all-test[select all test]
** Are pages readable when zoom is  at least 200%?
* Screen reader testing:
** Most common assistive technology used in testing
** Difficult to learn

## Accessibility Testing

*  accessibility testing:
** Testing site is accessible for users with disabilities
* What are screen readers and how they work?
** Software that reads the screen. For websites, uses  DOM info.

## !

* How to do accessibility testing?
